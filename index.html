                        The point of this technical document is to educate the reader about some of the basics to using
                        git
                        and github. It is assumed the reader has some basic understanding of the terminal and the
                        ability to
                        navigate the GitHub webpage. This is, by no-means a full documentation of git, but merely
                        touches on
                        the very basic
                        functions.

                            Git is one of the most widely used version control &#40;VCS&#41; systems in the world today.
                            Git
                            is
                            an actively-maintained open source project developed by the creator of the Linux operating
                            system,
                            Linus Torvalds.
                            <span class="spacer"></span>
                            Git is considered a distributed version control system &#40;DVCS&#41;, meaning every
                            developer on a project has a working copy of code, which is also a repository that can
                            contain
                            all
                            changes made to a project by individual team members.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can think of Git like a more powerful option of saving a document. Unlike a saved
                            document,
                            <i>saving</i> with git records the differences in files and keeps a record of each
                            <i>save</i>.
                            You can review changes, examine how a project has grown, and restore previous versions of
                            your
                            code.
                            Paired with GitHub, you can show off your work or collaborate on projects with other
                            devlopers.
                            <span class="spacer"></span>
                            By pairing Git and Github, you not only keep a backup and change-log of your code on your
                            machine and remotely,
                            but you also keep a day-by-day log of your coding habits. This is useful to add to your
                            portfolio to show potential
                            companies or clients your work. It is very important to get a good understanding of how Git
                            and
                            Github work as Git is
                            considered to be an essential skill for modern developers.

                            In this documentation, we are going to assume you have Git setup and configured on your
                            machine
                            already, along with an account created on <a href="github.com">Github.com</a>.
                            If you haven't yet installed and setup git, you can follow the guide at <a

                        <h2>The Git Workflow</h2>
                        <p>
                            While using Git, you will quickly realize there is a very standard workflow. Select a link
                            or
                            continue to learn more about each section.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><a href="#working-directory">Working Directory</a></li>
                            <i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>

                            <i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                            <li><a href="#local-repo">Local Repo &#40;HEAD&#41;</a></li>
                            <i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                            <li><a href="#remote-repo">Remote Repo &#40;MAIN&#41;</a></li>
                            <i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                            <li>Repeat</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 id="working-directory">Working Directory</h3>
                        <p>
                            We begin with the first part of the workflow, the working directory, which is the area you
                            are
                            currently working, and where your files are saved.
                            Changes in your working directory aren't <i>saved</i> by Git just yet. You will later need
                            to
                            add the files to be tracked by Git.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="stage-area">Staging Area</h3>
                        <p>
                            Second up in the workflow is the staging area, which is when Git begins tracking and saving
                            changes in your files.
                            When you add a file to the staging area, Git takes a snapshot of the changes made at that
                            current time.
                            If you modify a file after adding it to the staging area, Git will not recognize the changes
                            made until the files
                            that were modified are added back to the staging area.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="local-repo">Local Repo</h3>
                        <p>
                            The local repository or repo, contains everything in your Git directory. It saves snapshots
                            of
                            all of your commits and changes. Files from your staging area are added to the local repo
                            after
                            you commit your changes.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="remote-repo">Remote Repo</h3>
                        <p>
                            Finally, comes the remote repository. In this documentation, we are using <a
                                href="github.com">GitHub</a> as our remote repository.
                            It's the same idea as a local repo, but gives the extra peace-of-mind of not only having a
                            backup of your files in a second location,
                            but also allows you to work on projects with other developers remotely.

                        <p>
                            The first step in creating a new project is to setup a project directory. You have the
                            option of
                            either setting up the repository locally, or you can setup your remote repository first.
                            Below
                            we will go over the differences in the different options.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Local Repo</h2>
                        <p>
                            The first option you have is to create your repository locally. This can be helpful if you
                            don't
                            currently have an internet connection or you have a project you've already created and now
                            want
                            to store it remotely.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Create A New Directory</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first option we have is to create a new directory from scratch and turn it into a
                            repository. Start by creating a new folder or directory for your project. Using your
                            terminal,
                            navigate to your new directory
                            and enter the following command to initialize the repository:
                            <code>$ git init</code>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Existing Project</h3>
                        <p>
                            Use your terminal to navigate to your main project folder that you would like to turn into a
                            repository and enter the same code as before:
                            <code>$ git init</code>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Connect to GitHub</h2>
                        <p>
                            Now that you have a repository created, the next step is to connect it with your GitHub
                            account.
                            Login to GitHub and create a new repository. You will be given a few options to setup an
                            exhisting local directory, which one you choose will vary on how you previously initially
                            setup
                            Git.
                            In this documentation we are going to assume you set up SSH so you won't need a password for
                            every push to GitHub.
                            <code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new_repo</code>
                            Your local repository is now connected to GitHub!
                        </p>

                        <h2>Remote Repo</h2>
                        <p>
                            The other option you have is to copy a repository that is already on GitHub that you created
                            previously:
                            <code>$ git clone git@github.com:username/repo</code>
                            This copies, or clones all of the contents of the directory and creates a local repository
                            on
                            your machine.
                        </p>

                            Now that you have a repository setup and linked to your GitHub account, we can move on to
                            the
                            next part of the workflow; staging.
                            We discussed staging in a previous section so we know that is the step where we tell git to
                            start tracking changes made to files.
                            We can do so with a couple options:
                            <code>$ git add filename</code>
                            which will add a specific file you select. You can also add multiple files by spacing the
                            names
                            out. Or you can add all of the files using:
                            <code>$ git add .</code>
                            Where the period is used to specify all files.
                            Lastly you can check which files you have added to be staged by using the command:
                            <code>$ git status</code>
                        </p>
                </section>

                <!-- /* ======================================== */ -->
                <!-- /*              COMMIT CHANGES              */ -->
                <!-- /* ======================================== */ -->

                <section class="main-section" id="commit_and_push">
                    <header class="header-content">Commit And Push</header>
                    <div class="content-container">
                        <p>
                            The final half of the workflow will be to commit and push your files.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Commit</h2>
                        <p>
                            We have our repository setup and files added to our staging area, it is time to commit
                            those changes to the local repo or the HEAD:
                            <code>$ git commit</code>
                            The best practice method of doing a commit is to add a brief description to the commit:
                            <code>$ git commit -m "changes"</code>
                            The newest file changes have now been updated in your local repository.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Push</h2>
                        <p>
                            By pushing your files to your GitHub repository, you are creating a remote backup of your
                            code
                            and gaining the ability to work on projects with others. We won't be covering branchs/forks
                            in
                            this documentation, so that leads us to the last command:
                            <code>$ git push</code>
                            Your files are now backed up remotely now as well, so if your computer ever crashes or dies
                            on
                            you; you will always have a copy of your work.

                            Thank you for taking the time to read this technical document and I hope it was able to help
                            give
                            some clarity to those looking to learn the basics of Git.
